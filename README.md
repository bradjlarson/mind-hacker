The name for this project is still up in the air. Thought right now is something related to mind-hacker or BetterMe. 

##Goal: An easy to use tool to become "better"

This tool should be very simple to use, and should provide a minimum amount of information, only the required amount, no more.
It should take less than 15 minutes each day to complete, and should be customizable to the user's needs. 

##What is "better"?

In the context of this tool, better can be quite broad. Typically the benefits are mental, but some are organizational.
Really, it's anything that has an expected positive impact on your life. 

##Structure:

The tool is designed to be very modular. The main function is composed of what I am calling "better blocks".

Each better block has its own template, its own javascript file, its own collection, potentially a session variable or two, optional settings, an optional way to track improvement, and optional charts or visuals.

I've created a couple initial better blocks, but I imagine that others will come up with other ideas which could easily be implemented. 

When a user signs up for the tool, they'll be presented with a default layout of better blocks that are broadly applicable. As the better block library grows, they will be able to change which better blocks they use to best suit their needs.

##What's next:

- Add the ability to view previous days submissions as a tab
- Add chart outputs of progress tab
- Add a home view to display once all the better blocks have been completed for the day
- Add a settings tab
- Add the ability to customize your better blocks
